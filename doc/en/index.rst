Notes
=====================

- Use THRotator at your own risk.
- Don't ask any question about THRotator to the game publishers.

  - Before reporting an issue to the publisher, you must first check that the same issue happens even if THRotator is uninstalled.

- THRotator forces a game to behave differently from the original design.
  So your replay data and scores acquired with THRotator might be rejected as genuine ones.
  It is highly recommended that you add a comment to let others know the replay or score is acquired with THRotator when you post them.
- Don't copy ``d3d8.dll`` and ``d3d9.dll`` to your system directory.
- THRotator's behavior is undefined on games not listed in supported products.
